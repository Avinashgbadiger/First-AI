# Spring AI Integration

This project aims to integrate various AI models with a Spring framework to create advanced AI-driven applications. The primary focus is on implementing features like AI Chat Assistance, Audio-to-Speech Conversion, and Image Generation.

## Features

- **AI Chat Assistance**: Integration of AI models to create intelligent chat assistants that can interact with users in real time.
- **Audio-to-Speech Conversion**: Utilize AI models to convert text to speech, allowing for dynamic voice interactions.
- **Image Generation**: Implement AI-powered image generation from textual descriptions, leveraging state-of-the-art models.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend of the application.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: AI model integration for natural language processing, image generation, and speech synthesis.
- **OpenAI API**: For integrating GPT models for AI chat assistance.
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**: For converting audio into text.
- **DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion**: For AI-driven image generation from text prompts.
- **Docker**: Containerization for running AI models and Spring applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or above
- Spring Boot (latest stable version)
- Maven or Gradle (depending on your build tool)
- Docker (if you're containerizing AI models)
- An AI API key (for services like OpenAI or Google Cloud)
